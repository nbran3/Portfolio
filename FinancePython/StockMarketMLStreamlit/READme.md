This is essentially the same thing as my Stock Market KNN notebook, but I did not add the economic data to this model because it would have to be updated every month, but it actually seems to perform better on market data and calcualtions such as RSI (based on the market data) then with the additonal of economic data such as 
interest rates.

Basically when you log into the website, you type in a stock ticker and the model runs in the background and you'll see a rundown of the stock, what the model predicted based on test data, scores, feature importance, and then most importanly the predicted stock price for tomorrow, I  would not use this for any real-world 
trading purposes, there isn't a lot of depth, and the calculations are quite elementary just put your money into a SP500 index fund and you'll be good for the most part.
