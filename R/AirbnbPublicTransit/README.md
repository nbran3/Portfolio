London and SF Bay Area is currently not working due to shapefile file routing errors

To summarize, this project initially was to do actual home prices in proximity to public transit, but obtaining home values, especially for London and Paris was basically impossible for me, and I did not want to pay a ton of money for access to some API for NYC and Bay Area housing prices, so I decided the next best option would be to use Airbnb data from https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/. Most of the subway/ public transit data was from official government sources, such as the governments of France, the United Kingdom, and New York City. However, for San Francisco and because it spanned several cities, I had to manually look up all the coordinates for each station specifically for Caltrain. I also could not Airbnb data for Alameda County outside of Oakland. I also obtained shapefiles for each land mass that was included, which was the City of London, Paris, and New York City, each of those cities had shapefiles on a borough level, meaning you can see Manhattan versus Brooklyn for example. For the SF Bay, I obtained shape files for San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, and Alameda Counties.

To calculate distance it was a simple K-means cluster model from the FNN library in R. I also applied a logarithmic calculation to the model because some of the SF Bay Airbnbs were far away from stations, but this had a marginal impact on the model.
The results were done in a simple linear regression and to be honest not one is even worth sharing, as there is obviously way more that goes into the price of Airbnb than something like public transit stations, outside of a few exceptions like Staten Island and San Mateo county, not one R-squared score was above .01,   which shows that in all reality there is no impact or relationship between the two variables.
