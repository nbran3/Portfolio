  Hi, My name is Noah Brannon. I graduated from the University of Michigan - Dearborn with a degree in 
    Economics in 2022. I am currently aspiring to be a Data Analyst using SQL and Python. This is my personal 
    portfolio website where you can see my personal projects. In the near future, I plan on obtaining a Master's Degree in Data Science from the 
    University of Michigan.
