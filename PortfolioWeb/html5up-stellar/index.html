											<h2>Welcome to my Portfolio Website!</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Hello, My name is Noah Brannon. I graduated from the University of Michigan - Dearborn with a degree in Economics in 2022. I am currently aspiring to be a Data Analyst using SQL and Python. 
											This is my personal portfolio website where you can see my personal projects. In the near future, I plan on obtaining a Master's Degree in Data Science or Applied Economics.</p>

										<h3>Census Project</h3>
										<p>This was an in-depth project involving Census Data from the United States Census Bureau. I utilized SQL, Python, and PowerBI for this project.
											In SQL I did data exploration using basic syntax, aggregation, window functions, joins, subquries, case statments, and create view functions. I then created a PowerBI presentation to summarize the SQL results.
											I then used python to do some data analysis in Python to find statistical relationships between the three different variables, median earnings, the proportion of college graudates, and the proportion of people with health insurance in each state. 
											 Here is the source code for the project - <a href='https://github.com/nbran3/Portfolio/tree/main/CensusProject'>Link</a>

										<h3>Baseball Project</h3>
										<p>This was in depth data analysis project utizling baseball statistics from 1945-2015 utizling Python and Microsoft Excel. 
											In Python I did a statistiscal analysis between the number of home runs per season and number of strikeout per season and found they were posistively correlated. Then I created a simple machine learning model via ARIMA to generate three 
											seasons worth of Wins for each of the 30 MLB teams and then mocked a playoff like scenario for each season. I then visualized the standings and the playoffs for each season in Excel.
										</p>

										<h3>United Kingdom Unemployment and Inflation Regresion Analysis</h3>
										<p>This was an economic and statistcal analysis to determine the relationship between the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation.
											Many people might believe there is some kind of relationship between the two variables, but they do not, and this paper confirms that. This was 
											my final school project for my Economics Statictics class. Here is the document link - <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xLK0O4-EGIqCCVaEqVNz0UpVCFGJk_Cs142qXve6tnU/edit?usp=sharing">Google Docs</a>

											<h3>GDP API Web Scraping and Predictive Modeling</h3>
											<p>In this project I connected to the Bureau of Economic Analysis API to web scrap the GDP of each state from the years 1998, 2002, 2007, 2012, 2017 and 2022. From that data I created a model that would predict 
												the GDP amount for each state for 2027, however the model was somehwat limited because the data I chose did not see any recessions or downwards trends, so the model believed GDP could only go up
												,so the results show a crazy increase in GDP, but that increase is not totally out of the picture, I give my reasoning in the READme file. Source - <a href='https://github.com/nbran3/Portfolio/tree/main/GDPForecasting'>Link</a>

											<h3>Wine Dataset Analysis</h3>
											<p>This was a simple data analysis project analyzing wine from around the world. I also created a linear regression model to determine the relationship between the price of wine
											and the ratings of wine via Python on a Jupyter Notebook. I found that there was a weak postive to almost no relationship between the price of wine and the rating of wine, meaning that ratings of wine do not impact the price of wine that much
