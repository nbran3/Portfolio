Hello this is a project involving NYC airbnbs. I analyzed an Airbnb dataset for New York City from 2019-2020. 
The file calculates various metrics, including the average price, average days occupied, and average number of reviews for each neighborhood. I also introduced new columns, such as "Price_to_Occupancy_Ratio" 
and "Price_to_Reviews_Ratio," which represent the ratios of average price to average occupancy and average price to average number of reviews, respectively within SQL. 
The analysis further explores specific listings with high price-to-occupancy and price-to-reviews ratios. 
Additionally, I calculated averages for major boroughs and categorized each neighborhood as "Above Average" or "Below Average" based on price, price-to-occupancy ratio, and price-to-reviews ratio. 
These findings provide valuable insights into the pricing and occupancy trends of Airbnb listings in different neighborhoods of New York City.
Here is a link to the visualizations that I created in Tableau Public.
