This project involves enhancing a database table called "StoreSales", which I got from Kaggle. I added new columns such as Revenue, Profit Margin, Discounted Price Difference, and Order Duration. 
The data in these new columns is computed and updated using SQL queries. The project also includes various SQL queries to analyze the data, including calculating average sales, total sales, total revenue, 
average discount, total quantity, and average order duration per region and per state. Additionally, the project explores the most common shipping method by state, 
the most popular category purchase by state, average discount by category, most profitable category by state, customers generating the most sales and profit, and customers using discounts. 
It also examines the correlation between sales and discounts, average profit by year and state, average sale price for customers in the technology category, biggest profit margin by customer, 
and sales, profit, and profit margin for each month of the dataset. I am currently working on the Tableau visualizations 3 of the 6 are done, which you can see here :
